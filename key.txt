Run as an Admin

cd C:\xampp\apache\bin
httpd.exe -k install -n "MyApacheService"
sc start "MyApacheService"

Open the Windows Services Manager by pressing Win + R, typing services.msc, and pressing Enter.
Locate the "MyApacheService" (or the name you chose) service in the list.
Right-click on it, select "Properties," and set the "Startup type" to "Automatic" if you want it to start automatically with Windows.
