Run as an Admin

cd C:\xampp\apache\bin
httpd.exe -k install -n "MyApacheService"
sc start "MyApacheService"

Open the Windows Services Manager by pressing Win + R, typing services.msc, and pressing Enter.
Locate the "MyApacheService" (or the name you chose) service in the list.
Right-click on it, select "Properties," and set the "Startup type" to "Automatic" if you want it to start automatically with Windows.


then  Install MySQL as a Windows Service:
run as an admin always
cd C:\xampp\mysql\bin

mysqld --install MysqlService --defaults-file="C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini"
This will install MySQL as a Windows service.

Start the MySQL Service:
Once installed, you can start the MySQL service from the Windows Services Manager (services.msc). Locate the MySQL service, right-click on it, select "Properties," and set the "Startup type" to "Automatic." Then, click "Start" to start the service. This ensures that MySQL starts automatically with Windows.

do this finally

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hostsales.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
